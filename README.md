Scroller game made with pygame. Not a fully finished product but I wanted more experance with 
OOP in python and doing something like this challenged me in ways that other types of software have not.

Did all of the artwork myself using photoshop and I wanted to see what it was like in the game development process.
In the future I may come back to finish this project, but after university exams, i lost interest in this particiular 
program and want to focus my time on something else. 

The resolution was very buggy while using replit, so I just recorded a video on VS code instead
